# Math Student Simulator

This project is my effort to learn certain aspects of math by implementing it as a program. It's an extension of my math relearning project at [http://www.thinkulum.net/wiki/Math_Relearning](http://www.thinkulum.net/wiki/Math_Relearning).

Even though the project is called Math Student Simulator, it's not really a simulation of a math student. It doesn't, for example, reproduce the kinds of mistakes students make or the clarifying questions they might ask. It's a model of the kinds of concepts and procedures a person might correctly have in mind at each stage of their math education, at least those that can be represented by a fairly simple computer program. I won't be using advanced methods like computer vision or natural language processing.

I'm coding the project in Python mostly because it's a language I already know and that's fairly easy to read. I'm using literate programming because it lets me treat the project as a writing exercise and ramble as much as I want.
